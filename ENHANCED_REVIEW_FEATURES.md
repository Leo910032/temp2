### 3. **Smart Suggestions**
Automatically analyzes your groups and provides intelligent recommendations:

#### **Merge Suggestions**
- Detects groups with similar contacts
- Shows similarity percentage
- Suggests which groups should be merged
- One-click apply

#### **Contact Addition Suggestions**
- Recommends ungrouped contacts for each group
- Based on:
  - Same company
  - Same email domain
  - Geographic proximity
  - Similar attributes
- Shows top 5 suggestions per group

#### **Quality Issues Detection**
- Groups with only 1 contact
- Very large groups (50+ contacts)
- Duplicate group names
- Low coverage warnings

**Toggle suggestions:**
- Click "Hide" to dismiss the suggestions panel
- Smart suggestions remain active in the background

### 4. **Drag-and-Drop Contact Assignment**
- **Drag contacts between groups** - Grab the drag handle (⋮⋮) and drag
- **Visual feedback** - Target group highlights when dragging over it
- **Automatic cleanup** - Empty groups are removed automatically
- **Works across the interface** - Drag from any group to any other group

**How to use:**
1. Select a group to view its contacts
2. Hover over a contact to see the drag handle
3. Click and drag to another group in the left panel
4. Drop to move the contact

### 5. **Validation & Quality Checks**

#### **Quality Score (0-100)**
Displayed in the statistics bar, calculated based on:
- Number of single-contact groups (penalty)
- Overall coverage percentage
- Group size distribution variance
- Color-coded: 🟢 Green (80+), 🟡 Yellow (60-79), 🔴 Red (<60)

#### **Real-time Validation**
- Warns about groups with <2 contacts
- Highlights quality issues with ⚠️ icon
- Shows ungrouped contacts count
- Prevents saving invalid groups

#### **Pre-save Validation**
- Groups must have ≥2 contacts to be saved
- Warns before excluding invalid groups
- Allows review before final save

### 6. **Visual Improvements**

#### **Color-Coded Groups**
- Each group gets a unique color palette
- 8 distinct color themes (purple, blue, green, yellow, pink, indigo, red, orange)
- Colors help distinguish groups visually
- Applied to:
  - Group cards
  - Badges
  - Contact count indicators

#### **Visual Indicators**
- 💡 Blue badge - Has smart suggestions
- ⚠️ Red warning - Has quality issues
- 🎯 Similarity score in suggestions
- ⋮⋮ Drag handle for contacts

  - Smallest Group
  - Quality Score
- Color-coded for quick assessment

#### **Responsive Layouts**
- 2-column layout on desktop
- Single column on mobile
- Scrollable lists with max heights
- Proper spacing and visual hierarchy

### 7. **Performance Optimizations**

#### **Memoization**
- `useMemo` for expensive calculations:
  - Statistics computation
  - Smart suggestions
  - Filtered/sorted groups
  - Ungrouped contacts
- Prevents unnecessary re-calculations

#### **Callback Optimization**
- `useCallback` for all handler functions
- Reduces re-renders
- Improves drag-and-drop performance

#### **Efficient Data Structures**
- Uses `Set` for fast lookups (selected groups, grouped IDs)
- Minimal DOM updates
- Shallow equality checks

#### **Lazy Rendering**
- Scroll containers for long lists
- Only renders visible items
- Max-height constraints prevent layout shifts

## 🎨 Visual Design Elements

- **Blue** - bg-blue-50, border-blue-300

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
- groups: Current groups with modifications
- history: Array of previous states (max 50)
- historyIndex: Current position in history
- selectedGroupId: Currently viewing group
- selectedGroups: Set of checked group IDs
- draggedContact: Currently dragging contact
- showSuggestions: Toggle for suggestions panel
```

### Smart Algorithms

#### Contact Similarity Score
```
Base scoring:
- Same company: +50 points
- Same email domain: +30 points
- Geographic proximity: +20 points (if < 0.01° distance)

Threshold: 30+ points = suggestion
```

#### Group Similarity Score
```
Average similarity of all contact pairs between two groups
Threshold: 40+ points = merge suggestion
```

#### Quality Score Formula
```
Start: 100 points
- Single-contact groups: -10 per group
- Coverage < 50%: -20 points
- Coverage < 70%: -10 points
- Low size variance: +10 bonus
Final: max(0, min(100, score))
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Groups not saving?**
- Check that groups have ≥2 contacts
- Look for error messages in browser console

**Undo not working?**
- History has 50-state limit
- Page refresh clears history

**Drag-and-drop not working?**
- Ensure browser supports HTML5 drag API
- Try clicking the drag handle icon (⋮⋮)

**Suggestions not showing?**
- Click group to view its suggestions
- Some groups may have no suggestions

**Performance issues?**
- Try filtering groups by type
- Reduce number of groups to <100
- Close other browser tabs
